# Laura and Ian

Wedding website for us.

This project was created using Create React App and then tied in as a headless Wordpress site. It isn't even used as the theme on the WP site, but the WP admin is used for creating all the data within this website.

Definitely didn't need to create the whole thing from scratch, but it was a fun project for us to do!
